ShadowGame
==========

A D&amp;D-like program that will calculate areas on a grid and offer a solo and multiplayer experience. In other words, I'm making a game.

Using C# with the XNA SDK.

Alright. So far, I have not written any code. I am currently in the stage of planning, as I write down the names of mystical creatures, and consider the arrays I shall be using in the future. Feel free to offer ideas, thoughts, information about bugs you've discovered, or art. It is very much appreciated! Now, let's talk a little bit more about the game.

You will customize a character. You will move around a grid, one turn at a time, dealing with pre-decided(Already randomized) creatures and situations. You can customize several characters and add them to a game(multiplayer). You can form groups with others and fight together, or alone, or against one another.



Attributes
==========

Basically what rules the game. When a situation arises, you can choose one attribute to use. The attribute's number will be added to a random number between one and six, and then the opposing creature's number will be subtracted from the total. If it's higher than zero, you win.

This is the best I gots in the way of attributes:

-Gallantry

   Strength, pretty much. Deals with attacking.
   
-Agility

   Defense. How well character can stand attack.
   
-Cleverness

   Deals with how well character deals with surprises, or puzzels.
   
-Stealth

   Ability to sneak around, thereby avoiding fights.
   
-Magnetism

   Basically, deals with how well you talk to pretty much any human ever.



As for "alignment", this is also what I have.

   -Noble
   -impartial
   -immoral
   
   Pretty self-explanatory.
